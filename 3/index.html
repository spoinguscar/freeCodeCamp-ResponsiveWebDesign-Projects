            </header>
            <p>You can use spoingus so solve world hunger. Just import the spoingus object using</p>
            <code>import spoingus</code>
            <p>and solve world hunger by calling the method:</p>
            <code>spoingus.solveWorldHunger()</code>
            <p>The full capabilities of the spoingus are not yet known. But here are some examples of methods that were successfully called: </p>
            <code>spoingus.spawnSpoingus()</code>
            <code>spoingus.turnOffSun()</code>
            <code>spoingus.spawnItem(itemCode)</code>
            <code>spoingus.silly() # Use with caution</code>
            <ul>
                <li>The spoingus library is <strong>language agnostic.</strong></li>
                <li>By using the spoingus library, you bequeath all earthly possessions to your overlord, who is spoingus.</li>
                <li>You can only call methods from the spoingus library <em>once</em>. After that, it seems to self-destruct.</li>
            </ul>

                <h3>Big Floppa</h3>
            </header>
            <p>The Big Floppa library seems to inherit some methods from the spoingus library, but also provides different functionality. You can spawn friendly NPCs by: </p>
            <code>bigFloppa.team()</code>
            <p>Calling the same method will cause the NPCs to disappear. This library is much more unexplored than the others due to the difficulty in finding the methods. Some other discovered methods are: </p>
            <code>bigFloppa.spoingleDoingle()</code>
            <p>which makes spoingle doingle. The next command is only here for documentation purposes, do not attempt to use it lest you end the world. (This method seems to be deprecated as of Feb 2025 as it seems that the Big Floppa library is succeeded by <a href="#Lil_Floppa">Lil Floppa</a></p>
            <code>bigFloppa.deleteBlueDot()</code>
            <ul>
                <li>This function was reversed only by the mercy of spoingus.</li>
                <li>Big Floppa was succeeded by <em>two</em>. Lil Floppa and Big Floppa Jr.</li>
                <li>Big Floppa Jr. was abandoned by its creators and the <em>fork</em> is called Lil Floppa.</li>
            </ul>

                <h3>Bingus</h3>
            </header>
            <p>Bingus is death, the destroyer of worlds. You can spawn bingus by: </p>
            <code>bingus.spawn(radius=10)</code>
            <p>Bingus, after spawning, will start by decimating everything between a 10 mile radius (default). This feature cannot be turned off and the radius cannot be a number lower than 10. Bingus also has the power to remove your hair: </p>
            <code>bingus.removeHair()</code>
            <p>It is known that this method is automatically called whenever a bingus is created. The best bingus method discovered by experts is:</p>
            <code>bingus.stare()</code>
            <p>which is the only method that does not result in people losing their hair or lives. It is only a piercing stare that makes your fear everything.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Bingus is <em>Bingus</em></li>
                <li>Bingus is spelled <strong>Bingus</strong></li>
                <li>Bingus is called "Bingus"</li>
                <li>Bingus automatically despawns in 10 seconds. A person can call the spawn method only once in their lifetime (one way or another)</li>
            </ul>

        <section id="Bulgus" class="main-section">
            <header>
                <h3>Bulgus</h3>
            </header>
            <p>Bulgus is usually very calm, but provoking it will have consequences. It is better to not spawn a bulgus.</p>
            <code>bulgus.spawn(distance=1, direction="eye-front")</code>
            <p>The default options will spawn "bulgus" 1 meter from your position. It is highly recommended to use the default "eye-front" option for direction and at least 50 for distance. It was also discovered by reverse engineering that there also exists a setMood method:</p>
            <code>bulgus.setMood()</code>
            <p>but it does not receive any arguments. Calling it seems to make the bulgus more bulgus. Bulgus also seems to inherit the stare function: </p>
            <code>bulgus.stare()</code>
            <p>but the bulgus stare seems to be one of benevolence.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Bulgus is big.</li>
                <li>Bulgus is nice (sometimes)</li>
                <li>Bulgus does not hurt anybody. (disputed)</li>

                <h3>Lil Floppa</h3>
            </header>
            <p>The Big Floppa was succeeded by Big Floppa Jr. which was forked into Lil Floppa. Even though they used to have similarities in their early days, Lil Floppa diverges heavily from its parent. Lil Floppa has only one discovered method:</p>
            <code>lilFloppa.address(text="Hi.")</code>
            <p>Lil Floppa seems to dislike the default option for the parameter <em>text</em>. Lil Floppa is not a bad library, he just does not like it when people greet him with very conventional and uncreative words. A plethora of have succeeded in making him happy: </p>
              <code>Howdy, partner!  </code>
              <code>What's cookin', good floppin'?  </code>
              <code>What's up, buttercup?  </code>
              <code>Hey there, sugarplum!  </code>

              <code>Salutations, my floppow!</code>
            </code>
            <p>The usual replies are one of these: </p>
              <code>Hi. # Lil Floppa Mad</code>
              <code>Hi! # Lil Floppa Not Mad</code>
            <ul>
